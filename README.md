# Python-Tutorials
Welcome to the basics of Python tutorials. Here you will be explained the Python programming with commands explained right below the code. I have prepared the most basics of the Python commands and their use in the code. The only minimum requirement is for you to have a suitable IDE. There are many, but I would like you to have PyCharm IDE. It's available on jetbrains website.
