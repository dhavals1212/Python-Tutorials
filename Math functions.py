#'round' function will round the values to the absolute integer value.
#Here in case of x 5.2 is closer to 5, it will be rounded to 5.

#'import' command will import math module to be used.

print(math.ceil(3.9))
#math.ceil will get the ceiling value. In case of 3.9 it's 4.

print(math.floor(2.5))
#math.floor will get the floor value. In case of 2.5 it's 2.
